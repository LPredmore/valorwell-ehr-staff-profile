# Plan for Setting Up Local ValorWell Application

## Overview
The goal is to connect and run the ValorWell custom React/Vite application locally against the local Supabase instance. This includes resolving any merge conflicts, configuring environments, installing dependencies, and verifying the build and runtime.

## Current Status
- Supabase is running locally at http://127.0.0.1:54321 (API) and http://127.0.0.1:54323 (Studio).
- Repository cloned to c:\Users\predm\Projects\valorwell-custom-final.
- Dependencies installed via npm install.
- Merge conflict in SessionDocumentationForm.tsx resolved with correct import: `import 'survey-core/survey-core.min.css';`.
- No remaining Git merge markers found in source files.
- Environment files (.env and env) already configured with local Supabase URL and anon key.

## Actionable Steps (TODO List)
- [ ] Confirm no remaining merge conflicts by reviewing key files (e.g., if any other files might have issues).
- [x] Update environment files with local Supabase credentials (already done, confirmed key matches provided value).
- [ ] Verify package.json scripts are correct (confirmed "dev": "vite").
- [ ] Run `npm run dev` and verify the application starts without build errors, serving at http://localhost:8080/.
- [ ] Validate that the UI loads properly and communicates with local Supabase (e.g., test fetching data or submitting a form).
- [ ] Stage and commit changes: `git add .` and `git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts, update survey-core import, configure local env"`.

## Potential Issues and Mitigations
- If build errors occur, check for missing dependencies or configuration issues.
- Ensure local Supabase has the necessary schema and data seeded.
- If connection to Supabase fails, verify the anon key and URL in env files.

## Next Steps
After approval of this plan, switch to code mode to implement any necessary changes and run the application.
